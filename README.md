AI-Powered B2B Job Outreach App

Overview
This application is an AI-powered B2B outreach tool designed to automate the process of identifying technical job opportunities and generating highly personalized cold outreach emails. It leverages cutting-edge LLMs, vector similarity search, and web scraping techniques to analyze job postings, identify key role attributes (like skills and experience), match them against an internal company portfolio, and compose tailored business communication. The final emails are designed to highlight how your company’s offerings align with the needs outlined in job descriptions.
Features
1. End-to-End Job Opportunity Analyzer
•	Accepts a URL to a public job posting (including JS-heavy websites).
•	Uses Playwright to asynchronously fetch and render dynamic job descriptions.
•	Extracts clean readable text via BeautifulSoup.
•	Highlights job role, expected skills, and years of experience required using LLM parsing.
2. Role and Skill Extraction with LLM
•	Uses a robust prompt-based Groq LLaMA 3.1 model to extract key job fields: role, skills, experience, and responsibilities.
•	Ensures reliable parsing even when the job post structure varies.
•	Always outputs valid JSON with predefined keys, enabling consistent downstream processing.
3. Portfolio Relevance Matching
•	Loads a structured CSV portfolio of services/technologies (tech stack and reference link).
•	Normalizes both job-required skills and portfolio keywords using a synonyms dictionary.
•	Performs skill-based filtering and returns matching portfolio links if at least one skill overlaps.
•	Links are passed to the email generator to support content relevance.
4. Cold Email Generator with Dynamic Tone
•	Generates personalized cold emails using Groq’s LLM.
•	Email content reflects the extracted job details and matched services.
•	Integrates up to 4 most relevant portfolio links into the email text.
•	Offers tone customization (e.g., Formal, Friendly, Technical, Concise) using a select box.
•	Supports regeneration of emails if tone changes or if a new draft is desired.
5. Email Preview and Utilities
•	Displays email subject and content using Markdown rendering.
•	Provides one-click buttons for:
o	Copy to clipboard
o	Open in Gmail
o	Open in Outlook
•	Embeds email body inside mailto-compatible deep links.
6. Job Summary Generation
•	Uses summarization prompts to display a 60-word preview of the job description.
•	Ideal for quick understanding without reading the entire post.
7. Vector Database Integration (ChromaDB)
•	Stores the internal company tech portfolio in a persistent vector store.
•	Indexes tech stacks as documents with metadata (URL links).
•	Can be expanded to support semantic search in future versions.
8. Experience Inference Engine
•	Uses multiple regex patterns to extract years of experience mentioned in text.
•	Handles variants like "5+ years of experience in backend engineering" or "Minimum of 3 years required."
•	Displays inferred experience level alongside role and skills.
9. Skill Normalization Engine
•	Uses a pre-defined synonyms dictionary to standardize skill names (e.g., "js" → "JavaScript").
•	Applied both during job extraction and portfolio querying.
•	Ensures robust skill matching even when different terminologies are used.
10. Streamlit Web App Frontend
•	Responsive layout with wide screen format.
•	All outputs and interactions are reactive (Streamlit reruns statefully).
•	Uses HTML injection for icon-styled buttons (Gmail, Outlook, Copy).
Code Modules
main.py
•	Entry point of the Streamlit app.
•	Handles user input, HTML parsing, state management, and rendering.
chains.py
•	Defines prompt templates and LLM call logic.
•	Separates out three chains:
o	extract_jobs() – JSON-based job field extraction.
o	summarize() – Short job preview summarization.
o	write_mail() – Email generation using job, tone, and matched links.
portfolio.py
•	Loads the internal service portfolio from CSV.
•	Uses ChromaDB to store and retrieve vector-matched examples.
•	Supports fuzzy skill matching using normalization.
utils.py
•	Provides functions to normalize skills.
•	Cleans and sanitizes raw HTML text.

Test Cases
✅ Test Case 1: Job Description Extraction
Purpose: Verify if the application can extract job title, description, skills, and experience from a live job posting URL.
Test Step	Description
Input	Paste a live job URL with structured job description (e.g., Microsoft Careers, Google Jobs).
Expected Output	- Extracted JSON with fields: role, skills[], description, experience.- Role and experience should be inferred even if not explicitly labeled.
Validation	Check Streamlit output for Job Title, Expected Skills, Experience, and Job Summary.
Notes	Use roles like “Data Scientist”, “DevOps Engineer”, “Embedded Developer” for variety.
✅ Test Case 2: Skill Matching with Portfolio	
Purpose: Validate that relevant portfolio links are matched based on skills extracted from job posts.
Test Step	Description
Input	A job post that includes skills like Python, AWS, Docker, Terraform.
Expected Output	Matching links from company_portfolio.csv that include these keywords in Techstack.
Validation	Ensure portfolio.query_links() returns list with at least 1 relevant link.
Notes	Test edge cases like skills written in lowercase, hyphenated, or abbreviated (e.g., “py”, “terraform”).
✅ Test Case 3: Email Generation (Cold Outreach)
Purpose: Ensure that the LLM generates a coherent, personalized outreach email aligned with job context and matched portfolio.
Test Step	Description
Input	Extracted job + 3–4 matching portfolio links. Tone = “Formal”.
Expected Output	- Subject line inferred.- Email body explains how your company’s capabilities map to job requirements.- Embedded job link + portfolio links.- Ends with 3-line signature.
Validation	Check if tone is formal and paragraphs include at least 2–3 matched services naturally.
Notes	Repeat for tone = “Friendly”, “Technical”, “Concise” to validate tone switching.
✅  Test Case 4: Regenerate Logic
Purpose: Validate that clicking “Regenerate” always fetches a different version of the email with same tone.
Test Step	Description
Input	Click “✨ Regenerate” multiple times.
Expected Output	- New variations of email are produced with different wording.- Tone remains consistent unless changed.
Validation	Confirm no reuse of previous phrasing or same sentence structure.
Notes	Enable temp=0.8+ to enforce creative variation in LLM output.
✅  Test Case 5: No Skill Match Warning
Purpose: Confirm the app warns when portfolio doesn’t match job skills.
Test Step	Description
Input	Job with rare stack (e.g., COBOL, Perl, Mainframes) not present in portfolio.
Expected Output	Streamlit shows: “⚠️ No strong match, but including job ‘X’ due to partial skill overlap.”
Validation	Email is still generated, but without portfolio links.
✅  Test Case 6: Clipboard Copy + Gmail/Outlook Buttons
Purpose: Validate export of email content to third-party email clients.
Test Step	Description
Input	After email is generated, click “Copy Email”, “Open in Gmail”, or “Open in Outlook”.
Expected Output	- Email body copied to clipboard.- Gmail/Outlook pre-fill the body and subject in compose window.
Validation	Manual test by pasting in Gmail/Outlook and checking structure.
Notes	Ensure mailto: encoding works as expected (special characters, newlines, quotes, etc.)
✅  Test Case 7: Multi-Tone Switching
Purpose: Test if changing tone triggers correct re-generation.
Test Step	Description
Input	Switch from “Formal” → “Technical” → “Friendly”.
Expected Output	- New email reflects tone (technical keywords, casual tone, etc.)- No reuse of prior output.
Validation	Observe tone style in email (greeting, wording, paragraph structure).
✅  Test Case 8: Scraper Timeout or Empty Page
Purpose: Handle slow or broken pages gracefully.
Test Step	Description
Input	A very slow-loading or minimal HTML job posting page.
Expected Output	- If fetch fails: “An error occurred: …”- If no job text: warning about missing job info.
Validation	No crash. App remains usable.
Conclusion
Overall, the application successfully transforms manual outreach into an intelligent, scalable, and user-friendly workflow for business development teams. With further enhancements like user authentication, usage tracking, multi-user dashboards, and CRM integration, this tool can evolve into a powerful platform for enterprise-grade outreach automation.
